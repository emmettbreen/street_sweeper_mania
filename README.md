Street Sweeper Mania was designed to test the interplay between your reflexes and memorization. You begin the game as a sweeper truck whose mission is to collect as much garbage as possible off of the road and earn as many points as you can. The mechanism to collect trash requires 5 different buttons that must be tapped in a timely manner as the trash approaches the sweeper truck. The memorization twist is that the buttons periodically switch places, so you must retrain your reflexes every minute to be successful in the game. Each round is endless, but they usually do not last long. The game will end if:

- you click the wrong button too many times (limit of 25)
- you collect too much trash without dumping it in a dumpster (truck has capacity of 25 items)
- you let >= 4 pieces of trash get by

What makes Street Sweeper Mania unique is that it is a highly skill-based arcade game that has been thoroughly tested and developed to truly keep your mind working. It is not meant to be a mindless game to pass the time. Instead, it challenges its users to stay mentally sharp and agile over an extended period of time.
